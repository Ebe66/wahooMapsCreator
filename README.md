# wahooMapsCreator

This repository is is acutally in creation.

The aim is to provide a tool to create updated maps for Wahoo ELEMNT and Wahoo ELEMENT BOLT devices.

## Structure of the repository
It exists a version of the python files for Windows and for Mac.
Differences between the different OS are the used programs and the way of accessing/creating files.
Furthermore there are files which can be the same for the Windows and Mac python files. These are stored in the common_resources folder.

## Get it running
You have to install several programs first and then download definitions of land into the folder 'common_resources/land-polygons-split-4326'. These files are not stored in Github because they are too big.

## Contribution
You are welcome to provide input via Pull Requests, Issues or in any other way!
