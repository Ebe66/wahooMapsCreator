If anything is unclear or just wrong, let me know!
I am a Python noob myself, so these instructions are for noobs like us.


Python - The Python programming language interpreter

1a. Download Python 3.7.9 from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9.exe

    Check "Add Python 3.7 to PATH", select "Customize installation",
    set "Customize install location" to "C:\Python" and install.
	
1c. Reboot Windows to activate the path

1d. Run "python -m pip install requests" from cmd (Windows+R, cmd)


GDAL - The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library
   
2a. Download GDAL files for Python 3.7 from gisinternals
	gdal-204-1900-core.msi      from https://download.gisinternals.com/sdk/downloads/release-1900-gdal-2-4-4-mapserver-7-4-3/gdal-204-1900-core.msi
    GDAL-2.4.4.win32-py3.7.msi  from https://download.gisinternals.com/sdk/downloads/release-1900-gdal-2-4-4-mapserver-7-4-3/GDAL-2.4.4.win32-py3.7.msi
	
2b. Install gdal-204-1900-core.msi: 
    Select "Typical" setup
	
2c. Install GDAL-2.4.4.win32-py3.7.msi:
    Activate "Python from another location" and enter "C:\Python" in the textfield below. 
	Finish installation.
	

Java

3a. Download and install Java from 
    https://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=244582_d7fc238d0cbf4b0dac67be84580cfb4b (32 bit) or
	https://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=244584_d7fc238d0cbf4b0dac67be84580cfb4b (64 bit)
	
	
Windows

4a. Edit environment variables 
    by Windows search for "environ" or 
	run "rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl, EditEnvironmentVariables" from cmd
	
4b. Edit the PATH systemvariable and add ;C:\Program Files (x86)\GDAL
4c. Create new systemvariable GDAL_DATA with the value C:\Program Files (x86)\GDAL\gdal-data
4d. Create new systemvariable GDAL_DRIVER_PATH with the value C:\Program Files (x86)\GDAL\gdalplugins
4e. Create new systemvariable PROJ_LIB with the value C:\Program Files (x86)\GDAL\projlib


Windows-Wahoo-Map-Creator-Osmosis - The magic part!

5a. Download the folder "Windows-Wahoo-Map-Creator-Osmosis" 
    from https://my.hidrive.com/share/1t65k1b0lb
	
5b. Save the folder anywhere on drive C:

5c. In the folder edit the file #create_maps.bat with a text editor.
    Enter the countries for which you want to create maps.
	
	It should look like this:
	python wahoo-map-creator-osmosis.py netherlands
    python wahoo-map-creator-osmosis.py belgium
    python wahoo-map-creator-osmosis.py germany
    @pause
	
5d. Save and run #create_maps.bat

	Depending on the countries you choose, this will take a while. Countries like Russia
	may take many days and may crash your computer.
	Start testing with small countries like Malta or Iceland!

5e. You will find the ready country .zip files in the Output folder. Voil√°!
