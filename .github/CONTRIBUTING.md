## Structure of the repository
It exists a version of the python files for Windows and for Mac.
Differences between the different OS are the used programs and the way of accessing/creating files.
Furthermore there are files which can be the same for the Windows and Mac python files. These are stored in the common_resources folder.

Coding is updated in the develop-branch and merged into master if tested carefully!
